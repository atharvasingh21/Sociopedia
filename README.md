In this project, we will be building a social media web application using the MERN stack. The app will allow users to create accounts, post updates, follow other users, 
like  and comment on posts, and search for other users or posts. The app will be designed  with a responsive user interface, allowing users to access the app on desktop and mobile 
devices.
The MERN stack offers many advantages for building web applications, including faster development time, increased scalability, and easier maintenance. This project will demonstrate
how to build a social media app using this technology stack, providing a practical example for developers interested in learning more about MERN stack development.
Overall, this project aims to showcase the potential of the MERN stack for building 
modern and scalable web applications, particularly in the context of social media.
